# 1. Exploring Categorical Data

## Bar chart expectations
Suppose you've asked 30 people, some young, some old, what their preferred flavor of pie is: apple or pumpkin. That data could be summarized in a side-by-side barchart. Here are three possibilities for how it might look.

Which one of the barcharts shows no relationship between age and flavor? In other words, which shows that pie preference is the same for both young and old?

## Contingency table review
In this chapter you'll continue working with the comics dataset introduced in the video. This is a collection of characteristics on all of the superheroes created by Marvel and DC comics in the last 80 years.

Let's start by creating a contingency table, which is a useful way to represent the total counts of observations that fall into each combination of the levels of categorical variables.

The dataset has been loaded into your workspace as comics.

Type the name of the dataset to look at the rows and columns of the dataset.
View the levels() that the align variable can take.
View the levels() that the gender variable can take.
Create a contingency table of the same two variables.

#### Print the first rows of the data
comics

#### Check levels of align
levels(comics$align)

#### Check the levels of gender
levels(comics$gender)

#### Create a 2-way contingency table
table(comics$align, comics$gender)

## Dropping levels
The contingency table from the last exercise revealed that there are some levels that have very low counts. To simplify the analysis, it often helps to drop such levels.

In R, this requires two steps: first filtering out any rows with the levels that have very low counts, then removing these levels from the factor variable with droplevels(). This is because the droplevels() function would keep levels that have just 1 or 2 counts; it only drops levels that don't exist in a dataset.

The contingency table from the last exercise is available in your workspace as tab.

Load the dplyr package.
Print tab to find out which level of align has the fewest total entries.
Use filter() to filter out all rows of comics with that level, then drop the unused level with droplevels(). Save the simplified dataset over the old one as comics.

#### Load dplyr
library(dplyr)

#### Print tab
tab

#### Remove align level
comics_filtered <- comics %>% filter(align != "Reformed Criminals") %>% droplevels()

#### See the result
comics_filtered
