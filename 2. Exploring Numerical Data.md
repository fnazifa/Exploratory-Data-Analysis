# Exploring Numerical Data

## Faceted histogram
In this chapter, you'll be working with the cars dataset, which records characteristics on all of the new models of cars for sale in the US in a certain year. You will investigate the distribution of mileage across a categorial variable, but before you get there, you'll want to familiarize yourself with the dataset.

The cars dataset has been loaded in your workspace.

Load the ggplot2 package.
View the size of the data and the variable types using str().
Plot a histogram of city_mpg faceted by suv, a logical variable indicating whether the car is an SUV or not.

#### Load package
library(ggplot2)

#### Learn data structure
str(cars)

#### Create faceted histogram
ggplot(cars, aes(x = city_mpg)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~ suv)
  
## Boxplots and density plots
The mileage of a car tends to be associated with the size of its engine (as measured by the number of cylinders). To explore the relationship between these two variables, you could stick to using histograms, but in this exercise you'll try your hand at two alternatives: the box plot and the density plot.

A quick look at unique(cars$ncyl) shows that there are more possible levels of ncyl than you might think. Here, restrict your attention to the most common levels.

Filter cars to include only cars with 4, 6, or 8 cylinders and save the result as common_cyl. The %in% operator may prove useful here.
Create side-by-side box plots of city_mpg separated out by ncyl.
Create overlaid density plots of city_mpg colored by ncyl.

#### Filter cars with 4, 6, 8 cylinders
common_cyl <- filter(cars, ncyl %in% c(4, 6, 8))

#### Create box plots of city mpg by ncyl
ggplot(common_cyl, aes(x = as.factor(ncyl), y = city_mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot()

#### Create overlaid density plots for same data
ggplot(common_cyl, aes(x = city_mpg, fill = as.factor(ncyl))) +
  geom_density(alpha = .3)
  
## Compare distribution via plots
Which of the following interpretations of the plot is not valid?

#### Answers: The variability in mileage of 8 cylinder cars is similar to the variability in mileage of 4 cylinder cars.
  
## Marginal and conditional histograms
Now, turn your attention to a new variable: horsepwr. The goal is to get a sense of the marginal distribution of this variable and then compare it to the distribution of horsepower conditional on the price of the car being less than $25,000.

You'll be making two plots using the "data pipeline" paradigm, where you start with the raw data and end with the plot.

Create a histogram of the distribution of horsepwr across all cars and add an appropriate title. Start by piping in the raw dataset.
Create a second histogram of the distribution of horsepower, but only for those cars that have an msrp less than $25,000. Keep the limits of the x-axis so that they're similar to that of the first plot, and add a descriptive title.
  
#### Create hist of horsepwr
cars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = horsepwr)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  ggtitle("data pipeline")

#### Create hist of horsepwr for affordable cars
cars %>% 
  filter(msrp<25000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = horsepwr)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  xlim(c(90, 550)) +
  ggtitle("data pipeline 2")
  
## Marginal and conditional histograms interpretation
Observe the two histograms in the plotting window and decide which of the following is a valid interpretation.

#### Answer: The highest horsepower car in the less expensive range has just under 250 horsepower.

## Three binwidths
Before you take these plots for granted, it's a good idea to see how things change when you alter the binwidth. The binwidth determines how smooth your distribution will appear: the smaller the binwidth, the more jagged your distribution becomes. It's good practice to consider several binwidths in order to detect different types of structure in your data.

Create the following three plots, adding a title to each to indicate the binwidth used:

A histogram of horsepower (i.e. horsepwr) with a binwidth of 3.
A second histogram of horsepower with a binwidth of 30.
A third histogram of horsepower with a binwidth of 60.

#### Create hist of horsepwr with binwidth of 3
cars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = horsepwr)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3) +
  ggtitle("data pipeline")

#### Create hist of horsepwr with binwidth of 30
cars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = horsepwr)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 30) +
  ggtitle("data pipeline")

#### Create hist of horsepwr with binwidth of 60
cars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = horsepwr)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 60) +
  ggtitle("data pipeline")
